      <title>A Blog About My Thoughts of Gartner's Microservices Piece</title>

     <div class="w3-container">Gartner published its' insights into Enterprise perspective on Microservices. Overall, the piece balanced opinion with data
      and expanded greatly on everthing they felt was under the scope of research. I think that while it was a long piece, it manages to
      also keep me engaged based on the images and depictions they used to explain their research and thoughts. One of the things that I did find interesting was
    the breakdown of the the services or as Gartner said the different levels of granularity. It also made it more palletable to understand what this breakdown looks
    like. Their "Figure 1. Different Names for Different Levels of Service Granularity" is what I am referencing when I touch base on the levels of granularity. There
    are many factors and risks that should be managed to be taken into account based off the information provided in terms of what companies should seize utilizing microservice(s)
       or what microservice(S) has to offer your application without too much of a hassle...irreparable hassle? I'm not sure if I would jump that far ahead, but just in my
       natural disposition, I believe anything is possible.</div>
